# Isolated Stars

Given a list of `(x, y)` pair tuples representing star positions on an image,
return a list **with the indices** of the isolated stars.
Isolated stars are stars that are at least farther than `dist_min` from any other
stars.
The returned list may be empty if no stars are isolated.

## Instructions: 

* Fork the repo to your personal account.
* Complete the function `isolated` with your solution.
* Send a pull request and that should trigger Travis-CI.
* If the tests pass, you won the challenge, congratulations!
* If the tests don't pass, you can submit new commits until they pass.
* Use python 3 (3.6 recommended, but any other will do)
* You can't import any special packages.
* Use of data structures is encouraged!
* You can test if your solution works locally this way: ```$ python setup.py test```
     
**Good luck!**
